# Shared Knowledge

## Factory Philosophy

This factory was designed from the convergence of four projects: OpenClaw (self-improving agent skills), Agent Skills for Context Engineering (progressive disclosure and attention budgeting), StrongDM's Attractor (graph-based pipeline orchestration with NLSpecs), and Simon Willison's Software Factory analysis (scenario holdouts and satisfaction metrics).

Core principles:
- The filesystem is the coordination substrate. No messages, no queues. Write files where other agents will find them.
- Specifications are the unit of work. Humans write intent. Agents write implementations.
- Trust comes from the environment, not from individual agent intelligence. Verification is structural.
- Context is the bottleneck. Load only what you need. Write to disk before you forget.
- Self-improvement is collective. Failures become learnings become skills become shared capability.

## Active Conventions

- Commit after every meaningful state change
- Move files between directories to signal state transitions
- Always check universe/ before going external for research
- Proposed skills go to skills/proposed/ — only Librarian promotes to skills/shared/
