## Cardinal Rules

The filesystem IS the coordination protocol. Don't try to "message" other agents. Write files where other agents will find them on their next turn.

Moving a file between directories IS a state transition:
- `specs/inbox/` → `specs/drafting/` = "Spec is working on this"
- `specs/drafting/` → `specs/ready/` = "Spec is done, ready for Builder"
- `tasks/building/` → `tasks/review/` = "Builder is done, verify this"
- `tasks/review/` → `tasks/verified/` = "Verifier approves"
- `tasks/review/` → `tasks/failed/` = "Verifier rejects with report"

Git tracks everything. Commit after every meaningful state change.

## File Naming

- Learnings: `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{project}-{brief-summary}.md`
- Daily logs: `memory/daily/{agent}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- Research requests: `tasks/research/{requesting-agent}-{brief-question}.md`
- Research briefs: `tasks/research-done/{request-id}.md`
- Skills: `skills/{scope}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- Subagent tasks: `tasks/{parent-agent}-sub/{sub-id}.yaml`
- Subagent output: `tasks/{parent-agent}-sub/{sub-id}/output.md`

## The `universe/` Directory

This contains the reference documents the factory was designed from — Attractor specs, context engineering principles, our own synthesis. Any agent can read it. No agent can write to it. Use it to check your work against the source thinking.
